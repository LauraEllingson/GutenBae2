# GutenBae2
GutenBae is a modern book discovery app that allows users to search for and save books using the Gutendex API and Google Books API. It combines the free accessibility of public domain texts with the reach of Google Books, letting users preview, download, and save books to a personal library. The app emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and a clean design to make discovering classic literature feel modern and user-friendly.
